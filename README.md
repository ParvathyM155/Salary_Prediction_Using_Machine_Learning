# Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning


## 📖 Overview
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict if an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000. It leverages demographic and employment data to identify key factors that influence salary brackets.
This project implements a Decision Tree-based classifier to predict whether an employee's salary is above or below $50K/year, using demographic and employment features like age, education level, and working hours. The solution includes:  
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding categorical features)  
- Model training & evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)  
- Visualization (heatmaps, classification metrics)  
- Sample predictions in a structured table  


## 🚀 Key Features
🐍 **Clean Code** – Well-documented Python logic.

📓 **Interactive** – Jupyter Notebooks for easy testing.

📊 **Visualized** – Detailed performance heatmaps and charts.

⚙️ **Workflow** – Simple, easy-to-replicate pipeline.
